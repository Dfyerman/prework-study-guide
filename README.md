# Daniel's Prework Study Guide

## Description

-The motivation of this project was to help other bootcamp students learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.
-I built this project to help me understand what goes into each of the process's of developing a web application.
-It helps me understand that not everything comes at once and understanding these components takes time.
-I learned that there are many different aspects of developing a web application and if something doesn't work, not to stress because I will eventually figure it out and learn it.
